        Quick hummus recipe
        This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.
        It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.
        Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes.
        It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

  <blockquote cite="https://www.webmd.com/diet/hummus-recipe-and-benefits">
    <p><em>Hummus</em> that creamy dip that hails from the Middle East, has a reputation as a clean, healthy food.
      It deserves it.
      All the main ingredients are super foods in their own right.
      It's got chickpeas, sesame paste (tahini), garlic, and <strong>olive oil in most traditional versions. </strong>
      <p>Matthew Carter says, <q>Hummus never change.</q></p>
